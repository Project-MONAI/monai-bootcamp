    "Instead of returning a single image, accessing a member of the dataset produces a pair containing the image and segmentation after being pass through their respective transforms. One important aspect of this class is that the random state of each transform (`Compose` in this case) is set to that of the dataset before being applied. This ensures the same random operations are applied to each output, which is why the `RandSpatialCrop` operation chooses the same crop window for the image as well as the segmentation. By having separate transforms one can apply operations to images and not to segmentations (or vice versa), being careful that these unshared operations come after the shared ones.\n",
